# ABOUT ME:

Hi, my name is Egor, but some of my friends just call me "Hey." This is my second attempt. But nothing terrible is true?).

Giving yourself an assessment and writing your resume is quite a difficult task !.

# SKILLS:

1. Athlete, komsamolets and just handsome ....
2. There is a wild desire to learn programming.
3. And about the fact that on the weekend I save the universe from threats, I think you should not tell)

# CODE EXAMPLES:

You can always see on GitHub my doors are open.

# EXPERIENCE:

As for experience, everything is scant here. I will not show specific parts of the code in the sense of their lack, but I really want to learn and will soon close this gap in my resume!

# EDUCATION:

Just a blank sheet! (and in the shower energy engineer)
